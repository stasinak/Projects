# Projects

#### This file contains several individual projects done during my studies

* ## [Evaluating a Bias Compensation method for Sequential Monte
Carlo](https://github.com/stasinak/Projects/tree/master/Sequential%20Monte%20Carlo)

    In this project we propose a method, which uses the asymptotic distribution of the log-marginal likelihood for the bias correction. We
evaluate this method empirically in order to conclude whether or not it improves the estimate compared to conventional methods.

* ## [Sentiment Analysis and Deceptive opinion spam for hotel reviews](https://github.com/stasinak/Projects/tree/master/Text%20Mining%20Project)
  
    In this project, we first perform a sentiment analysis using an SVM model for positive and negative reviews. The evaluation
of the model is done in a different dataset(reviews from a different source). We also perform a deceptive opinion spam(i.e classify the reviews as deceptive or truthful) starting with a
model selection between Gradient Boosting, SVM and Logistic regression.
